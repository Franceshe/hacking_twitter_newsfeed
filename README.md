2. Semantic analysis on who i follow 
3. recommendation algorithm on what to read
### Analyze Twitter data?
* Yes
- [ ] Yes, I'd love to do some machine learning research such as classification and clustering for personalized reading.
### Tweet, Retweet or Like?
* Yes
- [ ] Maybe not direct message, just use other features for building personalized tweets reading with can "seen" tag.
### Show Tweets or Twitter information off Twitter
* Yes
- [ ] Display Tweets outside of Twitter
### Show aggregate data about Twitter content
* Yes, I will probably upload my source code to github to just review the algorithm is legitimate. And if many people are getting interested, I might build an application on top of the algorithm to let everyone having "awareness " of what they are reading. Save their time by reading with related topics but not some random junk tweets. Tweets for me are a valuable source of information gathering and learning source, but I'd love to see more semantic analysis for better understanding.
